# Forex-bot

This is an attempt at making a algo-trading bot that could detect swings in exchange rates based on comodity data. It failed. But the next one will be better. I'd apreciate it if someone could maybe tell me if the reason it failed is because of the model itself or because the swings are simply not predictable based on comodity and stock data.
