# Forex-bot

This is an attempt at making a algo-trading bot that could detect swings in exchange rates based on comodity data. It failed. But the next one will be better. I'd apreciate it if someone could maybe tell me if the reason it failed is because of the model itself or because the swings are simply not predictable based on comodity and stock data.

This part of the readme has been writen after a second commit: I analyzed the data and, the model is simply not able to predict the swings in exchange rates not because the model is not appropiate but because these are not predictable with the given factors. Therefore, this model could never work. On to the next one!
